That must be close! Huge shout from Kuldeep and Rahul, but umpire Erasmus is unmoved. The Indian players get together to discuss about the review, and Rohit has gone for it! Okay a couple of things to see here. Has it pitched in line? And if it has, is it turning down leg? Oh ball-tracking shows it's pitching in line, impact is in line, but it's only clipping leg stump
