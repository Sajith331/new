21:40 Local Time, 16:10 GMT, 21:40 IST: 246 was never a challenging total. It was an iffy total maybe. But NZ have won it in a canter. Ravindra had his first failure. But they had Kane Williamson back and he celebrated it with a neat half-ton. He is Bradycardia to the Tachycardia that the game is in the middle. Just didn't let the stress of a WC chase to get to you. Had it in control and they entered the cruise control mode when Mitchell gave him company. An unlucky thumb injury meant KW had to retire hurt but the damage was done. Mitchell seemed flawless the moment he hit the first ball for a sixer. He made his intentions clear from ball one and seemed like he was batting on a different turf. NZ barely have any loose ends. One team who has made it clear that they will be front-runners for the top four seats. Bangladesh now have succumbed to their second defeat. They were thwarted by England and NZ also have swatted them aside. This is their 6th loss against NZ from 6 games in World Cups. It could have been worse had it not been a fifty from Rahim. Shakib also doesn't seem 100 percent. That is bad news indeed. Hang on for the presentation ceremony
