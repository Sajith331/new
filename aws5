Najmul Hossain Shanto (comes in to talk in place of Shakib): [on Shakib] He is going for his scans. We will know after that. We didn't bat well. We didn't start well. We batted poorly even in the last game in the first 10-15 overs. The wicket looks good. Some bounce with the new ball. We have to bat little responsibly. If we bat a little carefully in the first 10-15, then we can do well. Our pace bowlers did well. I think the biggest improvement has been our fast bowling department. We will have to bat well.
